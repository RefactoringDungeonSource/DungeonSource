# Team assignment - Refactor Dungeon Project 

Assignment details:

Students will be assigned a team number (1-10)Redo the DungeonSource.zip using your team.  Each team will do a 
recording and save as an .mp4 file on zoom.  Yes, your group will make 1 recording in Zoom (zoom creates a .mp4 file) 
with all members(each member must speak in the recording) and explain your project (range from 10-15minutes).  
Video required and use of webcams if possible. Send instructor a labeled zoom.mp4 file labeled CSCD212 
Team#_TeamBuildAssign.mp4 along with your zip file.

The zip file above contains an assignment specification for the first version Heroes and Monsters assignment given way 
back in 2001. The zip also contains the instructor's source code for the solution to the assignment.  

It is your job to refactor that code to improve structure, readability, maintainability, and usability.  Employ the Object 
Oriented concepts you have learned throughout the quarter to accomplish this task.  Utilize patterns we have used so 
far. (e.g. 'favor composition over inheritance' or 'program to an interface, not an implementation).  Any improvement you 
can make to the existing design is a refactor.  Something as simple as changing visibility of a method or field suffices. 
Choosing better names is also legitimate. 
 
There are many ways to refactor the given code.  Some of the code uses (arguably) outdated tools from the Java API. 
You are welcome to employ current tools that do the job better as you deem necessary.
